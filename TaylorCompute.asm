;   2015-04-06 Completed the nextterm.cpp function
;  Date last modified: 2015-03-20(source code)
;  Purpose: This program will call on numerous files for their functions.
;  File name: ArrayProcess.asm
;  Status: No known errors.
;  Future enhancements: None as of now but willing to take recommendations.
