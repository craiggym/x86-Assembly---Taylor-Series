;Course information
;  Course number: CPSC240
;  Assignment number: 
;  Due date: 04-11-15
;Project information
;  Project title: TaylorCompute.asm
;  Purpose:  
;  Status: No known errors.
;  Project files: ArrayProcess.asm, geloength.cpp, inputqarray.asm, outputarray.cpp, sumarray.asm
;  Background: To understand how arrays work in assembly. Also to learn how to call on multiple functions and separate files to mimic assembly in the work environment.
;  Project references: 
;  This module's call name: ArrayProcess
;  Language: X86-64
;  Syntax: Intel
;  History: 
;   2015-03-28 Completed the macro portion of the assignment
;   2015-04-06 Completed the nextterm.cpp function
;  Date last modified: 2015-03-20(source code)
;  Purpose: This program will call on numerous files for their functions.
;  File name: ArrayProcess.asm
;  Status: No known errors.
;  Future enhancements: None as of now but willing to take recommendations.
;  Linux: nasm -f elf64 ArrayProcess.asm -o OutputFiles/arrayPrompt.o

;=============================================== Pre-conditions before entering loop ===============================================================================
;Before going into loop I will be using:
;  r14: Will hold the number of terms for the computation
;  r13: Will be the counter
;  xmm0: Will hold the old(and initial) term which will change every time nextterm is called. The result will be added to the sum (xmm15).
;  xmm1: Will hold the fixed value for x which was taken from user input
;  xmm15: Will hold the accumulated sum
